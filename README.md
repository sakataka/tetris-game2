## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **[Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)** - Modern JavaScript runtime and package manager
- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sakataka/tetris-game2.git
cd tetris-game2

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start development server
bun run dev
```

**üéÆ Start Playing:** Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser

### Build for Production
```bash
# Create optimized production build
bun run build

# Preview production build locally
bun run preview
```

The production build will be generated in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment to any static hosting service.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Development
bun run dev                    # Start development server (http://localhost:5173)
bun run build                  # Create production build
bun run preview                # Preview production build

# Testing
bun test                       # Run pure function tests (game, utils, lib)
bun run test:ci                # Run tests with reduced iterations for CI (35 iterations)
bun run test:dom               # Run DOM-related tests (hooks, store)
bun run test:all               # Run all tests (MUST pass before commits)
bun run e2e                    # Run Playwright E2E tests (headless)
bun run e2e:headed             # Run Playwright E2E tests (with browser UI)

## Fast Tests in CI

The project uses property-based testing with configurable iteration counts to balance thorough testing with CI performance:

- **Local Development**: Default 100 iterations for comprehensive testing
- **CI Environment**: Reduced to 35 iterations for faster builds (~95% confidence)
- **Custom Control**: Set `TEST_ITERATIONS` environment variable to override defaults

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Run tests with default iterations (100)
bun test

# Run tests with reduced iterations for CI (35)
bun run test:ci

# Run tests with custom iteration count
TEST_ITERATIONS=50 bun test

# Run tests with minimal iterations for quick feedback
TEST_ITERATIONS=10 bun test
```

## Running Benchmarks

Performance benchmarks are separated from regular CI to improve build speed while preserving performance monitoring capabilities.

### Available Benchmark Commands

```bash
# Run benchmark tests with verbose output
bun run bench

# Run benchmarks via CLI tool
bun run benchmark

# Run benchmarks in CI mode (structured output)
bun run benchmark:ci
```

### Benchmark Categories

The project includes several performance benchmark suites:

- **Collision Detection**: Tests `isValidPosition` performance across different board engines
- **Board Operations**: Benchmarks `placePiece` and `clearLines` operations
- **Comprehensive Tests**: Mixed operations simulating real gameplay scenarios

### Benchmark Execution

Benchmarks are located in `src/benchmarks/` and excluded from regular test runs:

- **Local Development**: Run `bun run bench` for immediate performance feedback
- **Automated Testing**: GitHub workflow runs benchmarks weekly on Mondays at 2 AM
- **Manual Triggering**: Use GitHub's "workflow_dispatch" to run benchmarks on-demand

### Reading Benchmark Results

Benchmark output includes:
- Operation duration in milliseconds
- Operations per second (throughput)
- Performance comparison between different implementations
- Results are stored as artifacts in GitHub Actions for historical tracking

### Development Usage

```bash
# Quick performance check during development
bun run bench

# Generate structured benchmark report
bun run benchmark:ci

# View benchmark files
ls src/benchmarks/
```

Benchmark results include commit hash and timestamp for tracking performance changes over time.

# Code Quality
bun run lint                   # Lint code with Biome (MUST pass before commits)
bun run format                 # Format code with Biome
bun run typecheck              # TypeScript type checking (MUST pass before commits)

# i18n Management
bun run check:i18n             # Check translation key consistency

# CI Pipeline
bun run ci                     # Full CI pipeline (lint + typecheck + test + build)
```

## üêõ Debug Mode (Development Only)

Debug mode allows developers to quickly test specific game states that would be difficult or time-consuming to reproduce during normal gameplay.

### Enabling Debug Mode

Add URL parameters to activate debug mode:
```
http://localhost:5173/?debug=true
```

### Available Debug Parameters

#### 1. Preset Board States
Use the `preset` parameter to load predefined game states:

```bash
# Single line clear setup
http://localhost:5173/?debug=true&preset=singleLine

# Double line clear setup
http://localhost:5173/?debug=true&preset=doubleLine

# Triple line clear setup
http://localhost:5173/?debug=true&preset=tripleLine

# Tetris (4-line) clear setup
http://localhost:5173/?debug=true&preset=tetris

# Near game over state
http://localhost:5173/?debug=true&preset=nearGameOver

# Near high score state
http://localhost:5173/?debug=true&preset=nearHighScore

# T-Spin setup
http://localhost:5173/?debug=true&preset=tSpinSetup

# Complex board with gaps
http://localhost:5173/?debug=true&preset=complexBoard

# Empty board
http://localhost:5173/?debug=true&preset=empty
```

#### 2. Custom Piece Queue
Control the sequence of pieces with the `queue` parameter:

```bash
# Specific piece order
http://localhost:5173/?debug=true&queue=IJLOSTZ

# All O pieces followed by all I pieces
http://localhost:5173/?debug=true&queue=OOOOIIII

# Comma-separated format also works
http://localhost:5173/?debug=true&queue=I,J,L,O,S,T,Z
```

#### 3. Game State Parameters
Set specific game values:

```bash
# Set custom score, level, and lines
http://localhost:5173/?debug=true&score=99900&level=10&lines=95

# Combine with presets
http://localhost:5173/?debug=true&preset=tetris&score=50000

# Random seed for reproducible games
http://localhost:5173/?debug=true&seed=12345

# AI debug mode with visualization
http://localhost:5173/?debug=true&ai=advanced&visualization=true
```

### Debug UI Features

When debug mode is active, a red panel appears in the top-right corner showing:
- Current debug mode status
- Active preset name (if any)
- Current piece queue
- Random seed (if set)

The debug panel also provides:
- **Quick Presets**: Buttons to instantly switch between different presets
- **Custom Queue**: Input field to dynamically change the piece sequence (press Enter to apply)

### Usage Examples

#### Testing Line Clear Animations
```bash
# Load single line clear state
http://localhost:5173/?debug=true&preset=singleLine
# Drop the I piece to trigger the animation
```

#### Testing High Score Updates
```bash
# Start with a score just below the current high score
http://localhost:5173/?debug=true&preset=nearHighScore
# Clear a few lines to trigger high score update
```

#### Testing Specific Piece Sequences
```bash
# Test handling of multiple S and Z pieces
http://localhost:5173/?debug=true&queue=SZSZSZ
```

#### Reproducing Bug Reports
```bash
# Use seed for deterministic piece generation
http://localhost:5173/?debug=true&seed=42&level=15
```

### Development Workflow Tips

1. **Quick Testing**: Use debug presets to jump directly to the game state you need to test
2. **Animation Testing**: Use line clear presets to test clearing animations without playing full games
3. **Difficulty Testing**: Set high levels to test increased game speed
4. **Edge Case Testing**: Use custom queues to test difficult piece combinations
5. **Bug Reproduction**: Use seeds to create reproducible test scenarios
