A modern, full-featured Tetris game built with React and TypeScript, featuring authentic gameplay mechanics, smooth animations, and cross-platform compatibility.

## üéÆ About This Game

A complete Tetris implementation with authentic gameplay mechanics, featuring all 7 tetromino pieces, advanced rotation system (SRS), and fair randomization. Includes hold system, ghost piece preview, progressive difficulty, and comprehensive scoring with local leaderboards.

**Key Features:**

- Cross-platform support (desktop & mobile with touch controls)
- Bilingual interface (English/Japanese)
- Smooth animations and visual effects
- Local high score tracking

## üéØ How to Play

**Objective:** Arrange falling pieces to create complete horizontal lines, which clear and award points.

**Basic Controls:**
- **Arrow Keys**: Move and rotate pieces
- **Space**: Drop piece instantly
- **C**: Hold current piece for later use
