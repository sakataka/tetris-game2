# Tetris Game Architecture - Action Plan

Based on comprehensive discussion with Gemini AI, here's the synthesized action plan for optimizing the Tetris game architecture.

## Executive Summary

The current architecture is solid with good separation of concerns. Key improvements focus on performance optimization, mobile experience, and preparing for future scalability. The DOM-based rendering is sufficient - no Canvas migration needed.

## Immediate Actions (Priority: High - This Week)

### 1. Implement Performance Monitoring System
**Goal**: Establish baseline metrics before making optimizations

```typescript
interface PerformanceMetrics {
  fps: number;
  inputLatency: number;
  renderLatency: number;
  droppedFrames: number;
  cpuUsage: number;
}
```

**Implementation**:
- Add React DevTools Profiler integration
- Create performance overlay for development builds
- Track frame timing with `requestAnimationFrame`
- Log metrics to console in development mode

### 2. Optimize BoardCell with Fine-grained Selectors
**Goal**: Reduce unnecessary re-renders from 200 to only changed cells

```typescript
// Current (inefficient)
const { board } = useBoardSelectors();
const value = board[row][col];

// Optimized (efficient)
const cellValue = useGameStore(state => state.board[row][col]);
```

**Benefits**: 
- Only affected cells re-render on state changes
- Significant performance improvement for board updates
- Better React DevTools profiling results

### 3. Add Immer Middleware to Zustand
**Goal**: Improve code maintainability without performance penalty

```typescript
// Before
set(state => ({
  ...state,
  board: state.board.map((row, y) => 
    y === targetY ? [...row.slice(0, x), value, ...row.slice(x + 1)] : row
  )
}))

// After (with Immer)
set(produce(draft => {
  draft.board[targetY][x] = value;
}))
```

**Trade-off**: +12KB bundle size for significantly better developer experience

### 4. Set Up Performance Benchmarks
**Goal**: Automated performance regression detection

- Create benchmark suite for critical operations
- Add to CI pipeline with performance budgets
- Alert on FPS drops below 60 or input latency > 16ms

## Short Term Actions (Priority: Medium - This Month)

### 5. Refactor Game Loop to Singleton Pattern
**Goal**: Decouple game logic from React lifecycle

Key improvements:
- Implement `TimeProvider` interface for testability
- Use `useSyncExternalStore` for React 19 compatibility
- Add explicit initialization/cleanup methods
- Enable step-by-step testing mode

### 6. Implement Mobile Gesture Recognition
**Goal**: Native-feeling touch controls

Features to implement:
- Tap detection (< 200ms touch)
- Swipe detection with direction and velocity
- Gesture debouncing to prevent accidental inputs
- Haptic feedback on successful gestures

### 7. Add Comprehensive E2E Tests
**Goal**: Ensure critical user journeys work correctly

Test scenarios:
- Start game → Play → Score → Game over flow
- Pause/Resume functionality
- Reset with confirmation dialog
- Mobile touch controls
- Keyboard controls

### 8. Optimize Bundle with Code Splitting
**Goal**: Faster initial load times

Strategy:
- Extract game engine to separate chunk
- Lazy load settings, high scores, and animations
- Use React.lazy() for non-critical UI components
- Implement progressive enhancement

## Long Term Considerations (Priority: Low - Future)

### 9. Web Worker Architecture (Optional)
**Goal**: Ultimate performance by moving game logic off main thread

Architecture:
```typescript
// Main thread
const workerBridge = {
  subscribeToState(callback: (state: GameState) => void): () => void,
  dispatch(action: GameAction): void,
  getSnapshot(): GameState
};

// React component
function useWorkerGameState() {
  return useSyncExternalStore(
    workerBridge.subscribeToState,
    workerBridge.getSnapshot
  );
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Guaranteed 60 FPS UI regardless of game complexity
- Better battery life on mobile devices
- Easier testing of pure game logic

### 10. Enhanced Game Features
**Goal**: Prepare state structure for future features

Add to GameState:
```typescript
gameMode: 'marathon' | 'sprint' | 'ultra';
combo: number;
statistics: {
  piecesPlaced: Record<PieceType, number>;
  linesCleared: Record<1 | 2 | 3 | 4, number>;
};
```

Defer until needed:
- T-spin detection (requires rotation history)
- Replay system (requires command pattern)
- Multiplayer support (requires different architecture)

## Architecture Decisions

### Decision: Continue with DOM Rendering
**Rationale**: For a 20x10 grid, DOM performance is more than sufficient when properly optimized with fine-grained selectors. Canvas would add complexity without meaningful benefits.

### Decision: Use React Concurrent Features
**Strategy**: 
- High priority updates (user input) use standard `set()`
- Low priority updates (gravity) use `startTransition()`
- This keeps UI responsive during game updates

### Decision: Functional Programming Over Classes
**Rationale**: Maintains consistency with current codebase, better tree-shaking, easier testing, and natural fit with React hooks ecosystem.

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- Desktop: 60 FPS, <16ms input latency, <50MB memory
- Mobile: 60 FPS (30 minimum), <32ms input latency, minimal battery impact

### Code Quality Metrics
- 80%+ test coverage for game logic
- Zero TypeScript errors with strict mode
- Bundle size <200KB gzipped

### User Experience Metrics
- Instant response to all inputs
- Smooth animations without frame drops
- Intuitive mobile controls

## Implementation Order

1. **Week 1**: Performance monitoring + BoardCell optimization
2. **Week 2**: Immer integration + performance benchmarks
3. **Week 3**: Game loop refactoring + initial E2E tests
4. **Week 4**: Mobile gesture recognition + code splitting
5. **Month 2+**: Evaluate Web Worker architecture based on performance data

## Risk Mitigation

- Each change is independently valuable and can be rolled back
- Performance monitoring ensures we catch regressions early
- Progressive enhancement approach maintains working game throughout
- All architectural changes preserve existing public APIs

## Conclusion

The current Tetris implementation has a solid foundation. These optimizations will enhance performance, improve developer experience, and prepare for future features without requiring a major rewrite. The key insight from Gemini is that architectural purity (Web Workers, Canvas) should be balanced against practical benefits - and for this game, the current DOM-based approach with targeted optimizations is the sweet spot.
