# discuss-with-AIs

Execute comprehensive multi-round discussions with Gemini CLI and O3 MCP to enhance Claude Code's analytical precision through diverse perspectives and iterative refinement. Claude leads the analysis and proposals while incorporating objective evaluations from both AIs to formulate the final implementation plan.

Claude must engage in deep thinking (Ultrathink) throughout the discussion process.

## Mandatory Execution Steps (Must Follow Exactly)

### Step 1: Preparation
- Clarify discussion topic
- Create `./docs/discussion_logs/` directory
- Generate TIMESTAMP (format: 20250706_121500)

### Step 2: Execute 3 Rounds of Discussion (Mandatory)
**Each round must include:**

1. **Create Claude's Analysis and Proposals**
   - Document specific analysis for current round
   - Build upon insights from previous rounds

2. **Query Gemini and O3 in Parallel**
   - Send query via `gemini` command
   - Send query via `mcp__o3__o3-search`

3. **Generate Required Files (2 per round)**
   - `./docs/discussion_logs/gemini_round{1,2,3}_TIMESTAMP.md`
   - `./docs/discussion_logs/o3_round{1,2,3}_TIMESTAMP.md`

4. **Record Claude's Candid Impressions**
   - Emotional reactions to each AI's responses
   - New insights and expertise assessment

### Step 3: Generate Final Conclusion (Mandatory)
- Create `./docs/discussion_logs/conclusion_TIMESTAMP.md`
- Integrate all 3 rounds of discussion
- Include detailed GitHub Issue specifications

## 🚨 Critical: Required File Generation
**Must create exactly 7 files:**
1. `gemini_round1_TIMESTAMP.md`
2. `gemini_round2_TIMESTAMP.md` 
3. `gemini_round3_TIMESTAMP.md`
4. `o3_round1_TIMESTAMP.md`
5. `o3_round2_TIMESTAMP.md`
6. `o3_round3_TIMESTAMP.md`
7. `conclusion_TIMESTAMP.md`

## Implementation

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Common configuration setup
setup_common_config() {
    TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
    LOG_DIR="./docs/discussion_logs"
    mkdir -p "${LOG_DIR}"
    
    # Implementation constraints shared across discussions
    IMPLEMENTATION_CONSTRAINTS="## Implementation Constraints and Priority Criteria
- **High Priority**: Major technical impact, implementation foundation, dependency origins
- **Medium Priority**: Feature completion, user experience enhancement, performance optimization  
- **Low Priority**: Extended features, future considerations, enhancements
- **Future Consideration**: Premature for current technical stack/design

## Generative AI Execution Context
- **Executor**: Automated implementation by generative AI (Claude, etc.)
- **Effort Constraints**: None (pursue optimal solution within processing capacity)
- **Technical Stack**: [Consider only existing technology constraints]
- **Quality Standards**: [Test coverage, performance requirements, etc.]

## Generative AI Implementation Characteristics
### Tasks Well-Suited for Generative AI
- Type definitions and interface design
- Code generation based on established patterns
- Utility and helper function implementation
- Test code creation
- Documentation generation and updates
- Refactoring (when structure is clear)

### Tasks Challenging for Generative AI  
- Adjustments requiring complex UX/UI judgments
- Browser-specific compatibility issues
- Performance fine-tuning (based on profiling results)
- Fine visual design adjustments
- Domain-specific complex business logic decisions"

    # Common evaluation criteria
    EVALUATION_CRITERIA="## Technical Evaluation
1. Implementation validity (appropriate technology choices, architecture alignment)
2. Performance impact (computational complexity, memory usage, response time)
3. Maintainability & extensibility (code readability, future change accommodation)

## Generative AI Implementation Suitability
1. Automated implementation feasibility (pattern clarity, implementation complexity)
2. Alignment with generative AI strengths (type definitions, utilities, tests, etc.)
3. Human judgment requirements (UX decisions, visual adjustments, domain knowledge)

## Risk Analysis
1. Potential risks (technical risks, operational risks, security risks)
2. Generative AI-specific risks (pattern misinterpretation, edge case oversight)
3. Mitigation strategy validity (measure effectiveness, automated verification)

## Task Decomposition Evaluation
1. GitHub Issue suitability (task granularity, independence, clarity)
2. Dependency organization (implementation order, blockers, parallelization)
3. Acceptance criteria clarity (automated testing, judgment criteria)

## Success Criteria

### ✅ Execution Success Conditions
1. **Complete Generation of 7 Files**

2. **Required Content in Each File**:
   - Claude's specific analysis (no placeholders)
   - Actual responses from AIs
   - Claude's candid impressions

3. **Required Elements in Final Conclusion**:
   - Summary of 3-round discussion
   - Detailed GitHub Issue specifications
   - 3 AI evaluations (10 stars + 100 point score)

### ✅ Handling AI Participation Errors
- If one AI cannot participate: Use fallback message and continue processing
- If both AIs cannot participate: Record error messages and continue with Claude's independent analysis

## Expected Outcomes

- **Discussion Logs**:
  - Complete dialogue history for each AI and round
  - **Claude's candid impressions**: Emotional reactions, expertise assessment, new insights
  - Cumulative knowledge accumulation

- **Final Conclusion File (1 file)**:
  - Claude's final judgment integrating both AIs' opinions
  - Transparent conclusions with adoption/rejection rationale
  - **Detailed specifications for GitHub Issue registration** (immediately actionable)
  - **3 AI evaluations**: 10-star rating + 100-point comprehensive score
  - User decision requests when uncertain

## Notes and Improvements

### Error Handling Improvements
- **Stable prompt delivery**: Use heredoc format for reliable prompt transmission
- **Response validation**: Properly detect empty responses or error messages, handle with fallback messages

### Discussion Process
- **Cumulatively provide previous discussion content each round**
- Final judgment made by Claude with clear reasoning
- **Final conclusion written at detail level sufficient for creating GitHub Issues even if memory is lost**

### File Management
- Storage location: `./docs/discussion_logs/`
- Always generate 7 files: Create complete log set regardless of AI participation status
